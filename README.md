## Welcome to my Tableau project repository!
 Here, I present interactive dashboards that analyze sales data from superstores, COVID-19 statistics, and crime rates.
 These dashboards aim to provide insights into various aspects of these domains and showcase my skills in data visualization and analysis using Tableau.

# Objective:
 The primary objective of this project is to analyze and visualize sales data from superstores, COVID-19 statistics, and crime rates to extract actionable insights.
 Through interactive dashboards, viewers can explore trends, correlations, and patterns in the data.

# Key Features:
* Data Sources: This project demonstrates connectivity to different data sources, including sales data, COVID-19 statistics, and crime rate datasets.
* Charts Variety: A diverse range of charts, such as bar charts, line charts, donut charts, maps, tables, and dual-axis charts, have been utilized to present the data effectively.
* Calculated Fields: Calculated fields, including IF statements, have been employed to derive additional insights and perform data manipulations.
* Sets, Hierarchies, and Groups: Sets, hierarchies, and groups have been created to organize and analyze the data efficiently.
* Joins and Level of Detail (LOD) Calculations: Understanding of joins and LOD calculations is demonstrated to integrate and analyze data from multiple sources at different granularities.
* Parameters: Parameters have been used to enhance interactivity and flexibility in data exploration.
* Analytics Pane: The analytics pane, including trend lines, has been utilized to uncover trends and patterns within the data.
* Dashboard Actions: Dashboard actions have been implemented to create interactive dashboards, allowing users to dynamically explore the data.
* Dashboard and Stories Creation: Creation of dashboards and stories provides a structured narrative and enables visualization of insights in a cohesive manner.
